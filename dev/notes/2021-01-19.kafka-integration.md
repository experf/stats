Kafka Integration Notes
==============================================================================

The plan is to have Stats push data to a `events` topic in Kafka, which passes
it down to Materialize, where Stats can query it with SQL (Postgres-flavor).

So we need to hook the Phoenix app up as a Kafka _producer_.


`event` Data
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Should be as flexible as possible. Help make names and structures consistent at
the source, not in the data layer. If it makes it here, save it, sort it out
later.

I'm thinking JSON format. It's so damn universal, stable, and simple.

It looks like [Apache Avro][avro] is the popular fast, schema serialization 
people are using with Kafka, but I doubt we want anything like that at the 
`event` level.

Client
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So... looks like Elixir/Kafka is a bit of a mess:

1.  [KafkaEx][] ⭐️ 459 ❗ 32
    -   Has some weird rolling merge with [Kayrock][]..?
    
2.  [Kayrock][] ⭐️ 17 ❗ 0
    -   Based on [kafka_protocol][]
    
3.  [kafka_protocol][] ⭐️ 67 ❗ 4
    -   Erlang
    -   Used by [Brod][]

4.  [Brod][] ⭐️ 492 ❗ 19
    -   Erlang
    -   Depends on [kafka_protocol][]
    
4.  [Kaffe][] ⭐️ 106 ❗ 11
    -   Wrapper around [Brod][]
    
5.  [KaufmannEx][] ⭐️ 86 ❗ 1
    -   Depends on [kafka_ex][], as well as `AvroEx` and `Schemex`

Ok, we want something wrapped around [Brod][], #1 on Kafka's 
[clients list](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Clients) for
Erlang (no Elixir-specific) and

> Full support for 0.9+ consumer protocol, very efficient producer
> implementation.
> 
> https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Clients#Clients-Erlang

Filling out that list are:

1.  [ekaf][] ⭐️ 160 ❗ 28
2.  [erlkafka][] ⭐️ 20 ❗ 1

[erlkafka]: https://github.com/milindparikh/erlkafka

Oh shit, this is probably going to be really useful as an example:

> ### KastleX - Kafka REST Proxy in Elixir ###
> 
> Kastle is a REST interface to Kafka cluster, powered by [Brod][] and 
> [Phoenix framework](http://www.phoenixframework.org/).
> 
> https://github.com/klarna/kastlex

from same org that does [Brod][] and [kafka_protocol][], some sort of shopping
platform thing from the Swedes:

Nice, we're getting somewhere now.
