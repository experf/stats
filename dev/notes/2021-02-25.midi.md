Midi Experiment Notes
==============================================================================

### Libs ###

1. https://spotlightkid.github.io/python-rtmidi/
2. Main dependency for rtmidi is https://jackaudio.org/

Every midi device has a name. For example, my drum machine can act as a midi device and can be accessed via the string `Elektron Analog Rytm MKII`. You'll use this device name when interfacing with the device through rtmidi. You can also create virtual input/output devices that allow you to receive midi in rtmidi and send it around to other places.

I was just running the script and specifying the port like this:

`python3 midi.py [port_name]`

ex. `midi "from Max 1"`
input from Max

ex. `midi "Elektron Analog Rytm MKII"`
input from hardware drum machine
